Eggbot Extension not showing in Inkscape Extensions Submenu

Make sure you select the correct directly. I was convinced I had it right the first time but I was wrong.
C:\Program Files\Inkscape\share\extensions

Eggbot Control Inkscape error

Had to reopen Arduino IDE and reupload sketchup. I assumed it was only necessary to have Arduino open for the initial upload

WRONG!

Eggbot cannot find eggbot_scanwin32.py

Tried manually changing port

Tried copying updated version of eggbot.py.

More debugging. Tried hardcoding VID PID for Arduino board in eggbot_scanwin32.py.

Determined error occuring eggboy.testSerialPort line with serialPort.write( 'v\r')
Error: WriteFile failed ([Error 6] The handle is invalid.)

32bit related?
